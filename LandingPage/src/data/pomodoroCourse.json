        "title": "What is Time Blocking?",
        "content": "Time blocking is a productivity method where you divide your day into specific time slots, assigning each slot to a particular task or activity. Unlike traditional to-do lists, time blocking creates a visual schedule that helps you stay focused and accountable. This approach transforms abstract tasks into concrete, scheduled commitments.",

        "title": "The Psychology Behind Time Blocking",
        "content": "Time blocking works because it leverages psychological principles like Parkinson's Law and the planning fallacy. When you assign specific time frames to tasks, you naturally work more efficiently to complete them within the allocated time. This method also reduces decision fatigue by eliminating constant choices about what to work on next.",

        "content": "Time blocking reduces mental fatigue by removing guesswork from your day. When your schedule is clearly defined, you're less likely to procrastinate or multitask.
